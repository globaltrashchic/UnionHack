###   Emma's flags

The first flag I changed was Egypt’s. I changed the complex crest that was in the middle to this symbol which represents the sun god in Egypt. I followed the same colour scheme as the flag to fit in.

For my second design I changed the Philippines flag. I added in a circle with a triangle symbol to represent equality just like the white triangle that is already in the flag.

My 3rd flag I changed is for Hong Kong. For this one I only changed the colour as the 5 stars are there to echo those on China’s flag, I changed the colour to yellow to also show the link.

Finally, I altered Canada’s flag. I changed the way the two stripes are facing. As one of Canada’s main values is equality and the symbol for equality is an equals sign, I designed their flag to reflect this.
