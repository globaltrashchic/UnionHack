###   Emma's flags

The first flag I changed was Egypt’s. I changed the complex crest that was in the middle to this symbol which represents the sun god in Egypt. I followed the same colour scheme as the flag to fit in.

For my second design I changed the Philippines flag. I added in a circle with a triangle symbol to represent equality just like the white triangle that is already in the flag.

My 3rd flag I changed is for Hong Kong. For this one I only changed the colour as the 5 stars are there to echo those on China’s flag, I changed the colour to yellow to also show the link.

Finally, I altered Canada’s flag. I changed the way the two stripes are facing. As one of Canada’s main values is equality and the symbol for equality is an equals sign, I designed their flag to reflect this.

### GLOBALTRASHCHIC FLAGS

Japan - The design has a red circle in the center signifying the sun. The difference compared to the flag of Japan is that the Rising Sun Flag has extra sun rays (16 for the ensign) exemplifying the name of Japan as "The Land of the Rising Sun".
